## Background
In this assignment, we were tasked to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of the population.


## Data

A D3 library was used to read in data from [samples.json]( https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json)


# Dashboard Visualization Components
### Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in Subject ID’s Bellybutton 
* OTU _ids used as the labels for the bar chart.
* OTU _labels used as the hovertext for the chart.

### Bubble chart that displays each sample’s data
* OTU_ids used for the x values.
* OTU sample_values used for the y values.
* OTU sample_values used for the marker size.
* OTU ids used for the marker colors.
* OTU _labels used for the text values.
