## Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


## Data
Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json

## Visualizations
### Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual
* OTU _ids as the labels for the bar chart.
* OTU _labels as the hovertext for the chart.

### Bubble chart that displays each sample
* OTU_ids for the x values.
* OTU sample_values for the y values.
* OTU sample_values for the marker size.
* OTU ids for the marker colors.
* OTU _labels for the text values.
